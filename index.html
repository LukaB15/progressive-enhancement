        <h4> The story</h4>
        <p class="Good">
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q>“Maybe.”</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” </q>The farmer again said, <q>“Maybe.”</q> 

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,” </q>and the farmer responded, <q>“Maybe.” </q>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>“Isn’t that great!” </q>Again, he said, <q>“Maybe.”</q>
            
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <h4> Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="Good">
            Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
